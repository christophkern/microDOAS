All places where microDOAS code has been altered by Adam Levy will be listed below.
Note: the line numbers listed may not be accurate but should be close.

Change log for microDOAS:
radiomanager.cpp and .h files added to project, included in globals.h (line 6)

transmitRadioData() function added to toolbox.cpp (line 240)

radio.setUpSerial(); function call added to data-collection.cpp (line 227)

radio.closeSerial(); function call added to start_CheckShutdownSwitch(void *arg) in toolbox.cpp (line 247) // currently commented out

added int Satellites to globals.h (line 40)
	to hold the number of satellites
added line to update int Satellites in gpsparser.cpp (line 348)

Declared a RadioManager object called 'radio' in globals.h (line 68)

WriteStdFile() acquired a mutex lock for the gps inside of the function (line 193). To be consistent between this and the transmitRadioData(), I removed that lock and put it in the calling function. This guarantees that WriteStdFile() and transmitRadioData() use the same gps data. The locks for the spectrometer and the gps are now aquired in the AcquireSpectrum() (line 439) function in cspectrometer.cpp.

added a comment you might want to look at in cconfig.cpp (line 32)

added tags to .xml file that control how frequently the .std file is sent and what frequencies are transmitted. see comments in microDOAS.xml

added struct SRadio to hold radio settings in cconfig.h

altered CConfig::ReadXML to load radio settings in cconfig.cpp (line 73)

added -std=c++11 to CPPFLAGS in seabreeze/common.mk (line 72) I did this so I could use std::to_string(int )

changed my function transmitRadioData to omit spectra not specified in xml to reduce transmitted data size

changed my RadioData struct to only use floats and to put the Spectrum at the end
